    The local runner service will start jobs one by one and attempt to run to
    the command associated with it. In order for jobs to actually be started
    `process_job_queue` must be called. This can e.g. be done periodically from
    the application event loop.

    Please note that while the LocalRunnerService will use Job instances
    returned from the JobRepository, these should not be returned to the called
    of LocalRunnerService. The reason for that is that they will have lost
    their database session, which will cause errors. So in general return the
    job id (or what ever information is useful) of the job if you need to
    process it in some other way downstream rather than returning the job
    instance.
